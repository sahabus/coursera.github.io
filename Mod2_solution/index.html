  <div id="chicken"><h1> Chicken </h1>
     <h3>Chicken Riggies</h3>
     <h4>Step 1</h4>
     Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt. Add pasta and cook until just al dente, between 5-7 minutes. Drain, but reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water. Set aside pasta and reserved pasta water.
     <h4>Step 2</h4>
     In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, add the oil and heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add chicken in 1 layer and cook until browned on all sides, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.
     <h4>Step 3</h4>
     Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in hot (or sweet) peppers and bell peppers, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes more. Add garlic and chili flakes (if using), and cook until just fragrant, about 1 minute.
     <h4>Step 4</h4>
      Pour in the white wine, and deglaze the pan by scraping up any browned bits. Allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato puree, and stir until everything is combined. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for about 7 minutes.
     <h4>Step 5</h4>
      Add the chicken to the pan and allow to cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the Parmesan and allow it to melt into the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
      <h4>Step 6</h4>
       Add the pasta and Â½ cup of pasta water to the pan. Stir until the sauce is cohesive, adding more pasta water as needed to loosen the sauce. Simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pasta has reached the texture you desire.
      <h4>Step 7</h4>
      Serve in bowls, and garnish with more cheese and basil.

  <div id="sushi"><h1> Sushi </h1>
     <h3>Homemade Sushi</h3>
     <h4>Step 1</h4>
     Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
     <h4>Step 2</h4>
     Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
     <h4>Step 3</h4>
     Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.
     <h4>Step 4</h4>
      Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.
     <h4>Step 5</h4>
      Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.
      <h4>Step 6</h4>
       Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
      <h4>Step 7</h4>
       Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.
